# Description:
# This software is dedicate to the server within the Automated bus system. The code will open a port and listen for data from the clients 
# in this case is the system that are on the bus. I will receieve the RFID # and qurry the database to see if the tag is within the database
# if it is the server will then log the card detected and notify who need to be notified.
