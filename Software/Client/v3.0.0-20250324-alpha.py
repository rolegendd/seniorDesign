# Description:
# This software interfaces with a Yanzeo SR681 RFID scanner to detect and 
# process RFID card data for an access control system. It reads serial data 
# from the scanner, extracts relevant RFID tag information, and logs detections.
#
# Dependencies:
# - Python 3.x
# - pyserial library (`pip install pyserial`)
# - binascii library 
# - time library
