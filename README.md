Welcome to the My senior design project a Senior Design from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. This system automates student bus attendance using RFID scanning, GPS tracking, and secure client-server communication to improve student safety and operational efficiency for school transportation.



📌 Project Overview
SmartBus is designed to:

Automatically detect when students board or leave the bus using RFID cards

Capture real-time GPS data

Log and transmit this data securely to a centralized server

Allow schools to track student activity, by time and location

Provide a foundation for future parent and admin access portals
