## v2.0.0-20250201 - aphla (Stable)

** Communitcation Test** : This build if for testing the communicaton from the hardward device (Yanzeo SR681) to an pc using Ubuntu OS.

### Current State 
- Establishes communication with the scanner and a PC with a linux OS.
- Script enables PC to print detected RFID Tags from the scanner to the minicom/terminal.

### Know Issues 
- In this current state the code detects only the current cards we attain. So card with a 
  different RFID Tag hex number the scanner will detect it but it will not be printed to the screens.
  Code must be adjusted to detect and print Tags with any ID #. (Portion of the code must be update to generalize detection 
  for multi/general purpose use.)
  
  
## v2.0.0-20250322 - beta 

This current build on the client side handles all the communication as previous version. This update also send the GPS coords., Time , and ID detected to the server.
